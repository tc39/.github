## Specifications

We develop the [JavaScript (formally, ECMAScript) specification][262], the [Internationalization API specification][402], the [Source Map specification][426], and, of course, [JSON][404]! We meet every two months to discuss proposals. To learn more about the process, please take a look at the [six stages][process] for new language feature [proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/).
